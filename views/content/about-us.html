        <p class="font-weight300">Innergize is the amalgamation of ‘Inner Strength’ and ‘Energy’. Its roots lie in the Bhagavad Gita, which says:</p>
        <p class="font-weight300 color-blue">"Krishna controls the Finite and the Infinite with inconceivable supernatural transcendental force. This is the power of inner energy."</p>
        <p class="font-weight300">It is this inner strength and energy that we wish to harness and deliver to people – both inside our organization and outside – and this is our medium to achieve universal prosperity to all those who touch the fountain of Innergize.</p>
